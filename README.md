## Portfolio Details


First I made three html pages: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html and a readme file.  I started to work on the index page first.  I put in a navbar that links to the other two pages.  I added effects to the links when clicked.  I made this element repsponsive to all viewports.  Next I added a jumbotron and a ticker.  Finally I added an "about" section and put in info about me, and made a footer to finish everything off.  Once the html page was finished I worked on a personal CSS file to fine tune some elements.

My next page was the contact.html page.  I copied the navbar code from the index page and made sure it worked properly.  Next I added a form group with a submission button.  With a name field, email field, and a message field anyone can send me an email with ease.  I inserted my footer and moved to the next page.  I made a personal CSS to fine tune some elements.

The last page I worked on was the portfolio page itself.  I inserted the navbar and footer elements first.  I made the main container hold a carousel element to show some of my past work.  I linked these to my code refactoring assignment, a test portfolio page I made, and a mouse shooting game I made before the bootcamp started.  I added pictures and indicators to advance the carousel.  Once that page was done I made a personal CSS and fine tuned a few elements.
